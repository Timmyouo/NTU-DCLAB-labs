# NTU Digital Circuits Lab — FPGA / Quartus Portfolio

Hands-on **FPGA system design** projects from the **Digital Circuits Lab (數位電路實驗)** course at **National Taiwan University (NTU), Fall 2025**, all built and demonstrated live on the **Terasic DE2-115 (Intel Cyclone IV E, EP4CE115F29C7)** development board.

Every project in this portfolio was **synthesized, placed & routed in Quartus II, programmed onto real hardware, and verified end-to-end using the board's actual peripherals** — external SRAM, VGA, RS-232, on-board audio codec, push-buttons, switches, seven-segment displays, and (for the capstone) a Bluetooth-linked Arduino controller. Where appropriate, **Qsys / Platform Designer** is used to compose the Avalon-MM subsystem (PLLs, RS-232 IP, custom masters) around the hand-written RTL.

## FPGA Skills Demonstrated

**DE2-115 peripheral bring-up on real hardware**
- **External SRAM** (IS61WV102416BLL, 1 M × 16): used as both an audio recording buffer (Lab 3) and a full-frame VGA graphics memory (Final).
- **VGA controller**: standard timing generator + per-pixel SRAM read path driving the on-board ADV7123 video DAC.
- **WM8731 audio codec** brought up from cold: I²C register programming, I²S ADC capture and DAC playback on the real codec chip.
- **RS-232 link** to a PC using the on-board MAX3232 transceiver and an Intel Avalon-MM RS-232 IP in Qsys.
- **UART over Bluetooth (HC-05)** at 115200 bps for a wireless controller link.
- **User interface peripherals**: push-buttons with debouncing, slide switches, seven-segment displays, red/green LEDs as status indicators.

**Quartus II flow, end to end**
- Top-level project assembly from `.qpf` / `.qsf`; explicit **pin assignments** for every external peripheral on the DE2-115.
- **SDC timing constraints** for the 50 MHz system clock plus derived clocks (VGA pixel clock, codec MCLK / BCLK, I²C SCLK).
- Full **synthesis → fitter → Assembler** flow targeting **EP4CE115F29C7**, producing the `.sof` programmed on the actual board.
- On-board debug using **SignalTap II**, LEDs, and seven-segment readouts as live debug taps.

**Qsys / Platform Designer (Altera SoC composition)**
- **Altera PLL (Altpll) IP**: clock synthesis for the I²C reference clock (Lab 3) and the VGA pixel clock (Final).
- **Intel RS-232 UART IP**: integrated as an Avalon-MM slave (Lab 2).
- **Custom Avalon-MM master**: `Rsa256Wrapper` exported as a bus master that actively drives the RS-232 IP's status / data registers through the Avalon interconnect (Lab 2).
- Automatic generation of the Qsys subsystem Verilog and integration into the Quartus project via `.qip`.

**RTL for FPGA, built to work on silicon**
- Hand-written FSMs and datapaths in **SystemVerilog**, targeted at Cyclone IV E LEs / M9K blocks.
- **Multi-clock-domain** design: 50 MHz system clock, VGA pixel clock, codec BCLK / LRCK, I²C SCLK, UART bit clock, all coordinated through PLLs and handshake synchronisers.
- Fixed-point arithmetic used in place of floating-point for DSP (audio speed change) and real-time physics (dart trajectory) — friendly to FPGA fabric.
